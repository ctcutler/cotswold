What I want to know is:
* why are we doing extra texts the second time through?
* why does doing extra texts seem to wipe out existing spans?

is there additional data?
is this a side effect of the d3 functional model that I don't understand?

maybe it is the exit().remove that's the trouble


aha. . . a theory: the span selection at the top is getting (naturally)
all the descendant spans, not just the direct children
