The fundamental problem we're dealing with here is the transformation between
a model that allows overlapping ranges and a view that doesn't.  

One approach says that in an overlap situation in the view we just truncate
the range that is "underneath".  This is attractive because it means that we
can maintain a one to one relationship between ranges and their representations
in the view.  I had a moment of doubt about this approach when considering 
a situation where one range is nested (which is to say, wholly enclosed) in
another (wouldn't that require us to truncate part of the enclosing range?)
but of course, HTML's syntax allows for nesting, just not overlaps.  

So that's what I'm going to go with for now, but it is intriguing to think about
whether we could use angularjs' directives to get around this restriction on 
nesting somehow.  I'm not certain that there is a way to do this. . . it is a 
pretty fundamental feature of the family of markup languages that HTML belongs to
. . . but it is worth considering.  

THE ALGORITHM

Input: a list of ranges where every range has a start offset, an end offset, 
style information, and a range id. The raw content that the offsets are indexes
into.  

* Go through the ranges, splitting each into two separate offset objects
  which has the style info and range id, as well as a type (start or end).
* Sort the list of offset objects by offset
* Create a prev variable and store a special offset object in it with
  no id or style info and an offset of 0
* create a variable called stack that is a list with one node (no style, no id)
  on it

for every offset object (cur) in the sorted list:
  if cur offset > 0: 
    if prev is start and cur is start:
      // *begin nested or overlapping*
    elif prev is start and cur is end:
      // *finish overlapping unless equal (in which case no overlap and no gap)*
    elif prev is end and cur is start:
      // *gap without id or style*
      // create leaf node and add to the nodes list of the node on the top of the stack
    elif prev is end and cur is end:
      // *finish nested*

  prev = cur

Output: a tree where each node contains either:
  * style, id, nodes
  -or-
  * content
like this (content nodes are not allowed at the top leve):

spanTree = [
    {
      style: "red", id: "range1", nodes: 
        [
            {content: "aaaaaa"},
            {style: "blue", id: "range2", nodes:[
                {content: "bbbbb"}
            ]},
            {content: "aaaaaa"},
            {style: "blue", id: "range3", nodes:[
                {content: "cccccc"}
            ]},
            {content: "aaaaaa"},

        ]
    },
    {
      style: "green", id: "range4", nodes: 
        [
          {content: "ddddd"}
        ]
    }
];

THE WRINKLE
All of this is built on the assumption that there is a one to one 
correspondance between chunks and spans.  This assumption fails in the 
case of nested ranges.  What I need to know is how angular handles
nested elements in its looping constructs.

What I want is an angular directive that will transform an arbitrarily
nested data structure into an arbitrarily nexted element structure.

And here it is:

But it has too many extra spans floating around.  I'm hoping I can clean
these up with:
http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngSwitch
or
