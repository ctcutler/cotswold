Cotswold
========

A tool for bidirectional artifact analysis that runs locally in a web browser. Cotswold enables linking and tagging of multimodal data, and the construction of long-term tracings of individualsâ€™ representational competence in a variety of creative media.


This project is under active developement so there are no guarantees that anything will work, but if you want to try it, check it out and load cotswold.html in Google Chrome.
