Cotswold
========

Cotswold is a literacy research tool that facilitates a bidirectional artifact analysis.  It enables linking and tagging of multimodal data and the construction of long-term tracings of individualsâ€™ representational competence in a variety of creative media.

The software is implemented in javascript and runs in a web browser but it runs entirely on the user's computer.  It requires no internet connectivity and stores all data locally.  

To run it, [check the project out](https://github.com/ctcutler/cotswold/archive/master.zip) and open app/index.html in Google Chrome.  By default, Cotswold loads some sample data for you to play with.
