X render line breaks right
X bug: when entering text into annotation, key commands still register

* annotate ranges (not just connections)
* respect HTML in uploaded data?
* change timepoint labels

* styling
* more and different colors

***

click to unselect
arrows on connections

***
* remove timepoints/edit existing timepoints
* can't reload same data file name twice
* user-adjustable column width
* paste new artifact data rather than uploading files
* weird behavior making a range inside another range
* test with larger text blobs, confirm scrolling works
* put the color selector somewhere else so it is not part of the popup
* drag and drop timepoints, artifacts, connections
* clone timelines and take them in different directions

Basic Functionality
X Create/delete connections
X Image region selection
* take a more object oriented approach to code organization
* Create/delete tags
* Create/edit connection tags and comments
* Create/delete timepoints
* Create/delete artifacts (incl. file upload)
* Proper storage

Later
* Create ranges/connections from diff between artifacts
* Better styling
* Output to PDF
* Zoom levels (incl. single artifact zoom, artifact pair zoom)
* Better layout functionality
* Video artifacts (with connections to certain points in the video)
