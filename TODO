X (2) new timepoint button only shows up in small area
X (1) delete the first timepoint and the titles shift down by one
X (1) image selection box is black
X (1.5) image range box colors don't work
X (1) new button doesn't remove image range boxes
X (3) horizontal scrolling
* (3) make timepoints wider when images displayed there are wider
* (3) connections and images ranges don't scroll properly horizontally when image overflows right most box
* (3) image range box at very right side of screen has invisible popup (page doesn't scroll for it)

* (1) can't kill final timepoint
* (2) statistics
* (2) should tell user if refusing to remove connected range (or just remove connections)
* (2) draggable image range boxes
* (2) tune diff algorithm
* (1) demo text has weird quote characters
* (3) screen "hops" when color changes, when you type
* (3) new feature: show multiple tabs, each with the same set of basic data (timepoints, artifacts, etc. but with different connections and ranges. . . so the basic data is shared but the markup is individual)
* (2) some of the demo ranges are off
* (1) make connections easier to click on
* (1) popups visible on hover (but after 2s delay if possible)


***


X per-timepoint comparisons (use checkboxes in headers)

* "files"

arrows on connections
* proof of concept works but:
** arrows are hanging off the edge of the line which means they overlap the thing they point to
** arrows are not the same color as the line
** there is no mechanism for saying which end of the line should have the arrow or for changing
   this
** the marker element is hardcoded in the root svg object in index.html

***

* remove timepoints/edit existing timepoints
* artifact titles (be able to name the chunks of text within a timepoint)
* per-artifact comparison checkboxes

* make unselected connections/ranges less opaque and selected ones more opaque
* can't reload same data file name twice
* user-adjustable column width
* paste new artifact data rather than uploading files
* weird behavior making a range inside another range
* test with larger text blobs, confirm scrolling works
* put the color selector somewhere else so it is not part of the popup
* drag and drop timepoints, artifacts, connections
* clone timelines and take them in different directions

Basic Functionality
X Create/delete connections
X Image region selection
* take a more object oriented approach to code organization
* Create/delete tags
* Create/edit connection tags and comments
* Create/delete timepoints
* Create/delete artifacts (incl. file upload)
* Proper storage

Later
* Create ranges/connections from diff between artifacts
* Better styling
* Output to PDF
* Zoom levels (incl. single artifact zoom, artifact pair zoom)
* Better layout functionality
* Video artifacts (with connections to certain points in the video)
