X make it possible to pile up colors and styles
* change timepoint labels

* styling
* more and different colors

***

click to unselect
arrows on connections
* proof of concept works but:
** arrows are hanging off the edge of the line which means they overlap the thing they point to
** arrows are not the same color as the line
** there is no mechanism for saying which end of the line should have the arrow or for changing
   this
** the marker element is hardcoded in the root svg object in index.html

***

* make unselected connections/ranges less opaque and selected ones more opaque
* remove timepoints/edit existing timepoints
* can't reload same data file name twice
* user-adjustable column width
* paste new artifact data rather than uploading files
* weird behavior making a range inside another range
* test with larger text blobs, confirm scrolling works
* put the color selector somewhere else so it is not part of the popup
* drag and drop timepoints, artifacts, connections
* clone timelines and take them in different directions

Basic Functionality
X Create/delete connections
X Image region selection
* take a more object oriented approach to code organization
* Create/delete tags
* Create/edit connection tags and comments
* Create/delete timepoints
* Create/delete artifacts (incl. file upload)
* Proper storage

Later
* Create ranges/connections from diff between artifacts
* Better styling
* Output to PDF
* Zoom levels (incl. single artifact zoom, artifact pair zoom)
* Better layout functionality
* Video artifacts (with connections to certain points in the video)
